# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Challenge

## Introduction: 

The name Superivsed Learning means that theres is a presence of a supervisor as a teacher. We as a teacher, teach the machine or train the machine with data that is well labelled. We provide the machine with a new set of data as examples for the supervised learning algorithm to analyze the training data and predict the outcomes. The labelled data has the correct outcome which the algorithm produces. 

Supervised learning is classified into two categories of algorithms: 

* Classification: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “Red” or “blue” , “disease” or “no disease”.
* Regression: A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.

# Background: 

Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. This data will be used to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans.
In this assignment, we will be building a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not.

## Instructions:

* We will create and compare two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier. 
* Before we create, fit, and score the models, we need to make a prediction as to which model we think will perform better. 
* Create a LogisticRegression model, fit it to the data, and print the model's score. 
* Do the same for a RandomForestClassifier. 

### Questions:
* Which model performed better? 
* How does that compare to your prediction?

# Analysis: 

My predictions were that Random Forest Model Classifier Model will yield better results. After fitting the models, splitting the data and printing the model scores. It can be concluded that both models performed well and yielded similar results. The model score for the Logistic Regression Model came out to be 0.9924680148576145 approximately 99% and the model score for the Random Forest Classifier model came out to be 0.9914878250103177 which is approximately 99%. Both models predicted values came out to be the same as their actual values.
